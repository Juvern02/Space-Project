# Space-Project
After their spaceship crashed onto an 
unknown planet, the player wakes up as 
the only survivor. The ship took some 
damage, unable to fly, but it looks fixable 
with resources from the planet. As the 
player ventures outside the ship, they 
discover a world of strange creatures â€“
noteworthy for the adventure logs. Can 
they repair the ship and return home 
with as much knowledge as possible, 
before their last reserves of oxygen run 
out?<br>
