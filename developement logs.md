Changed character and movement completely. here are other changes I made:<br>
- added a skin to the player<br>
- added animation for movements <br>
- added audio (background, footsteps, and landing after a jump)<br>
- I added "pushing objects" feature which can be used for solving puzzles. To create an object that can be pushed: 1. create an object 2. add ridig body component 3. change layer to "pushable"<br>
- Changed the terrain and added effects to it<br>
- fixed an issue where you can't jump inside spaceship<br>
- added prefabs to inside spaceship<br>
- I saved most of the work I've done outside spaceship in a scene called TestingScene. (Just in case you guys don't like the new terrain)<br>
- Currently, there is a problem with enemies. Couldn't solve it yet<br>
